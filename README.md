# Fredducation
## A Language Learning Blog
***

### What is Fredducation?
[Fredducation](https://www.fredducation.co/) is where I share bits of my language learning experience. Every week I try to put out a post, but I'm not to strict with myself on that. It's whenever feels right. 

### Why build Fredductation?
Initially I set out to develop my programming skills through creating 
something that anyone could see. A blog seemed like a good first choice and the topic of language learning, which is one of my hobbies, 
ensured it wouldn't be too boring. After making a few posts I 
realized how much I enjoy writing about my experiences. The reflection that is writing an article and going through photos to go along with it, became an exericse in practicing gratitude. 

### What does this repository offer?
For those that are curious as to how I made it or how one can make a 
similar site using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), I've made the code available to all. **Below is a nonexhaustive list of tools I used to build the site.** 

- Django Python Web Framework
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5 CSS Framework
- JavaScript
- Amazon Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) provided PostrgreSQL database.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) for serving static assests.  
- Amazon Simple Email Service (AWS SES) for sending out a newsletter and receiving user sumbitted contact information.
- Heroku Cloud Platform for deployment.
