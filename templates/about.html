                    The goal of Fredducation is to encourage language learners to interact with their target 
                    language in the real world. I aim to accomplish this by sharing my experiences as I learn Spanish, 
                    specifically with the people, places, media, food (yum!), and resources that I have learned so much from.
                    I felt that the language learning community that I interacted with was overly concerned 
                    with things like counting the hours of listening comprehension exercises until a milestone was 
                    reached, debating which learning apps bring fluency (the answer is none), or how to attain a certain accent 
                    in a target language. I thought to myself “isn’t the point of it all to enjoy the language?”. 
                    So I made a space to show how I enjoy interacting with my target language, Spanish. 
                    Hopefully this pulls people away from what’s not important in their own language learning journey.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    I’m Freddy Drew, creator of Fredducation. Like many people I took spanish 
                    classes in school but never treated it seriously, so I didn't learn much.
                    I think growing up I never appreciated the value of speaking a second 
                    langauge or education in general. Sometime recently that all changed.
                    I wake up most days with a mission to learn and, most importantly, have 
                    fun while I'm at it. I thought it'd be nice to reflect on my experiences 
                    while sharing them with other people, so I made this website. That's me in 
                    the photo below. It's one of the many photos I've taken while traveling. 
                    Traveling is very important to me. It is something I feel that I must do. 
                    It is for that reason that many of the photos on this site of people and places come from 
                    my travels. I hope you enjoy them especially.

                    It’s not just a play on my name and word education. It’s also a recognition that all of the posts 
                    on this site are about the many teachers in my language education. I do not 
                    consider myself an autodidact. Through this site I'm trying to show gratitude for
                    all the things that have taught me something. Originally it was going to be Freducation 
                    with only one <strong>d</strong>, but someone already owned most of the top-level domains for that name. 
                    Also I've always been more of a Freddy than a Fred, so Fredducation it was.

                    I didn't think of making a logo for the site until the project was well under way.
                    I'm not quite sure how it came to me but I thought something along the lines of
                    "langauge learning is a lot like explicit functions in algebra". So we take some function, 
                    <strong><em>f</em></strong>, with input <strong><em>x</em></strong>, and outcome 
                    <strong><em>y</em></strong>, represented all together as 
                    <strong><em>f(x) = y</em></strong> and we're ready to do our homework. With respect to 
                    langauge learning and myself, I (Freddy) am the function, the input (independent variable)
                    is the language, and the outcome (dependent variable) is my ability to comprehend that langauge.
                    So we arrive at the logo, <strong><em>f(ñ)</em></strong>, which is seen above this section and 
                    on the top left corner of the site's navbar. The <strong>ñ</strong> seemed like a perfect fit to represent Spanish.
                    Maybe in the future I'll target another language and plug in a character from that writing system.
                    As for how to represent the output of that function in the logo? I have no idea. Let's say the output
                    is the site. It's purple like everything else because why not?
